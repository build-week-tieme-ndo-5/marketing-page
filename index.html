        <h3>SAD</h3>
        <p>In the bid to transform smallholder farmers into semi-commercial farmers and agripreneurs, Tieme Ndo empower farmers to take advantage of business opportunities along the agricultural value chain through SAD (Small Agribusiness Development). The aim of SAD is to train farmers on entrepreneurship and value addition.</p>

        <h3>Credit Extension Package</h3>
        <p>CEP is our innovative package that eliminates the capital constraints limiting farmers ability to increase crop productivity and the adoption of improved farm technologies. With our CEP, farmers access fertilizers and seeds when they most need it at their convenience. They receive training and field extension to enforce appropriate usage of inputs and implementation of good agricultural practices. Without markets, farmers are less motivated to increase production – linking farmers to favorable markets is our topmost priority.</p>

        <h3>CoRD</h3>
        <p>“CoRD” (Commission on Repayments Deposit) is our unique incentive scheme that allows farmers to earn points for paying off their loan. For every minimum amount (GHC6.00) a farmer deposits with Tieme Ndo to offset the cost of their inputs, the farmer earns a point, which is credited to the farmer’s account. These points therefore allows the farmer to purchase extra farm inputs at no cost to the farmer. This incentive scheme is best described as “earn as you pay”, which is expected to reduce our default rate from 15% to 0% by end of April, 2020.</p>
