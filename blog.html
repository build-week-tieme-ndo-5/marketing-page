                <h3>Meet Our Farmers</h3>
                <p class="date">Agriculture / April 25, 2019</p>
                <p>
                  Meet farmer Valeria Dery (61), one of Tieme Ndo’s gallant
                  farmers. She is a farmer and a weaver. Before she joined Tieme
                  Ndo in 2017, she used to grow maize in her backyard farm.
                  Barely a year after joining Tieme Ndo, she has expanded beyond
                  her backyard farm to cultivating one acre of maize, rice and
                  groundnuts. According to Mrs Dery, she does not have to worry
                  anymore about mobilizing funds to pay upfront for seeds and
                  fertilizers, unlike previous years. For not paying cash for
                  fertilizers and seeds, Mrs Dery now uses her money to buy more
                  weaving threads to expand her weaving business. The power of a
                  small asset-based loan to a rural farmer is limitless.Through
                  our training sessions and a “strong farmer group system”,
                  where farmers meet every month to share ideas and support each
                  other, Mrs Dery has learned to implement Good Agricultural
                  Practices such as; planting in straight rows using strings and
                  pegs, on time fertilizer application etc. This has helped her
                  increase her maize yields from 3bags in 2017 to 7bags in 2018;
                  about 133% increase.For her, hard work, willingness to adopt
                  and implement improved farm practices and commitment to the
                  ideals of the organisation, Mrs Dery was crowned the overall
                  best farmer of the year among Tieme Ndo farmers during its
                  Second Annual Farmers’ Forum held in December, 2018 in Nandom,
                  Upper West Region. The forum is an annual event organised by
                  the organisation to create a platform for farmers to meet and
                  share their ideas, fears, and aspirations and reward farmers
                  for their commitment and collective effort to fight hunger and
                  poverty.

                  Opportunity To Empower Smallholder Farmers – Apply To Join Our
                  Team As An Agronomist
                </h3>
                <p class="date">Agriculture / February 1, 2019</p>
                <p>
                  Tieme Ndo, a thriving agribusiness startup in Nandom, is
                  looking for an Agronomist for a full time employment role in
                  the organisation. To apply for this opportunity, you should
                  have a high interest in agriculture or working with rural
                  folks. Tieme Ndo was founded in 2017 with the sole mission to
                  transform all rural farmers to agriprenuers in Africa. To this
                  end, Tieme Ndo has impacted more 1000 rural farmers by
                  increasing their access to fertilizers, seeds, weedicides and
                  other farm inputs at the time they need them most. Tieme Ndo
                  has also held workshops to train farmers on Good Agriculture
                  Practice (GAP). Tieme Ndo is a partner with Distribution Prize
                  Foundation in San Francisco and Ford Foundation (in
                  collaboration with Ashesi University). At Tieme Ndo, we
                  believe that, when women are empowered, trusted and supported,
                  they rise above all odds to achieve great things. Mrs Dery is
                  one of the 10 female farmers we empower to double their crop
                  yields and income every year. Women contributes over 50% of
                  the agriculture labor force in Africa and we believe that,
                  female farmers are poised to contribute achieve SDG goal 1 and
                  2. There are a lot more thousands of women with children,
                  especially widows out there who depend largely on agriculture
                  to feed their children. With small asset-based loans, they
                  could do more with their lives and earn more for their
                  families. Tieme Ndo is forever grateful to all women for their
                  commitment to the organisation.

                <h3>Nandom Farmers Increase Yields By 35%</h3>
                <p class="date">Uncategorized / January 15, 2019</p>
                <p>
                  Over one thousand smallholder farmers in the Nandom District
                  of the Upper West Region have been given improved and
                  certified seeds, fertilizers and ploughing services to help
                  them improve their livelihoods. The farmers were also trained
                  on best agricultural practices and offered extension services
                  to help them increase their yield while avoiding Post-Harvest
                  Losses (PHL). This has led to farmers increasing their yield
                  from 25 percent in 2017 to 35 percent in 2018. This translates
                  into between four and six bags an acre in 2018 as compared to
                  between one and four bags in 2017. Tieme Ndo which translates
                  to ‘Push me Up’ in Dagaare is a social enterprise which
                  focuses on providing farm inputs on both cash and credit to
                  smallholder farmer cooperatives in a bid to help them improve
                  their livelihoods Since it began its operations in 2017, Tieme
                  Ndo has reached over one thousand smallholder farmers in
                  Nandom, Jirapa, Lawra and Lambussie distributing over four
                  thousand bags of fertilizer and hundreds of certified seed
                  packets.
